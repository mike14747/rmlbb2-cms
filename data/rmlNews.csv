352,2019 League Average OPS,10/5/2019,"<p>Depending on which source you're using, there was a little disagreement in the league average OPS for the 2019 season. ESPN listed it as .757, while others (including Baseball-Reference) listed it as .758.</p>
<p>So, I decided to make an exact calculation using the following:</p>
<p>(42040 Hits + 15895 BB + 1984 HBP) / (166651 AB + 15895 BB + 1984 HBP + 1150 SF) = <strong>.32270 OBP</strong></p>
<p>72469 TB / 166651 AB = <strong>.43485 SLG</strong></p>
<p>Using standard rounding gives us a <strong>.758</strong> (which was <strong>.75755</strong> before rounding) league average OPS.</p>
<p>Hitters at or below <strong>.633</strong> will be considered unlimited.</p>
<p>Pitchers at or above <strong>.808</strong> will be considered unlimited.</p>
<p>Thanks to the message board posts for reminding me to post this.</p>"
353,RML Update,10/6/2019,"<p>Now that we've re-instating league dues, the preferred method of paying them is to mail a $10 check to Lloyd (made out to him personally) at his address listed in the Manager Directory. The deadline is November 9th.<br /><br />We now have a 'Rule Change and Voting' committee that will be in charge of those areas... including making the rules governing rule changes and voting. The 3-member committee consists of Dave Scott (Twins), Mike Borzenski (Mudhens) and George Calage (Reds). They're going to be monitoring the message board rule change forum, but you can and should interact with them concerning your ideas too.<br /><br />The first playoff LZP has been sent, so we can get the wildcard series started. The matchups are: Monarchs at Blaze in the AC and Reds at Yellow Jackets in the NC. These results are due to be reported to Mark by October 15th.<br /><br />Several files in the downloads dropdown have been updated (and they were also included earlier today in a group email). The files are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Preliminary unowned player list complete with usage and OPS numbers for all players and a position summary for each player from baseball-reference.com.</li>
<li>A new 'current player / money totals' file in a new format. I converted it into a spreadsheet since it lends itself better to that format. I'm not going to updating the player totals until after payrolls are submitted in November. Only money is being updated actively for now.</li>
<li>The RML master roster file which I've added 15 columns to the right of the historical columns. Most of the new columns are self explanatory, but here's an explanation of some things that might not be. Some players in the 'Protected Rate' column are highlighted. Those are the players eligible for long term contracts. A small number of players in the 'Minimum Offer' column are highlighted. Those are the players who were in contracts needing to be bought out because they aren't carded, with the number being the amount necessary to buy them out. The 'Position(s)' column is taken from baseball-reference.com (an asterisk before a position means they played 2/3 of their teams games at that position; everything after the slash means they played less than 10 games at those positions (I think D must mean DH). Finally, as a reminder (even though this isn't new), in the 'Ct' column (usually showing the length of a contract), there are some players showing a 'P'. That means the player was an in-season pickup that must be given back after the season ends.</li>
</ol>
<p>In all of these files, I've named the active sheet using the date it was last modified. You can find this date in the lower left corner as the sheet name (today's files have their sheets named 2019-10-06).</p>"

370,RML Update,10/25/2019,"<p>The updated Current Money Totals file in the Downloads dropdown now reflects finish money, debits/credit from trades, bonus money and playoff earnings. It's even more up to date than the file I sent out last night.</p>
<p>They don't include any player totals for major leaguers or minor leaguers.  Note, the Pelicans and River Dogs info (which is highlighted) in both of these files reflects the fact that they've already submitted their 2020 payrolls.</p>
<p>Which reminds me that payrolls for the 2020 season are due by thew end of the day on November 9th... as are our $10 annual league dues  (which need to be sent to Lloyd if it's in the form of a check... or to me if you'd like to pay in some other manner... they I'll forward it to Lloyd).</p>
<p>Just so the playoffs don't drag on too long, let's set a deadline for this current round at the end of October... the same date that our current trading period ends.</p>

402,The post-Draft Report,1/18/2020,"<p>The <strong>Unowned Player Draft</strong> went fairly smoothly this afternoon. The results are posted on the <strong>Message Board</strong> (Unowned Player Draft forum, 2020 Unowned Player Draft topic).</p>
<p>All in all, <strong>124 players</strong> were selected for a total of <strong>9,443K</strong>. The biggest spenders were the Expos and Dodgers... doling out 946K and 878K respectively. The TinCaps nabbed 13 players.. most of any team.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, there was a tie at the co-highest bid... made on <strong>Luis Arraez at 303K</strong>... by the Captains and the TinCaps. The <strong>Captains</strong> narrowly edged out the TinCaps in the tiebreaker by being #2 in reverse finish order to the #4 TinCaps. <strong>Zach Pleasac</strong> drew the other co-highest bid at 303K by the Dodgers.</p>
<p>The <strong>Master Roster</strong> and <strong>Player/Money Totals</strong> files have been uploaded to the website and include the results of the draft. In addition to the money totals being updated, the player totals have also been updated in the Player/Money Totals file.</p>
<p>Trading will remain open until <strong>February 1st</strong> and the final day to cut players without penalty is<strong> February 8th</strong>.</p>
<p>This year's <strong>Waiver Draft</strong> will be held on <strong>February 22nd</strong>. The deadline for submitting lists is <strong>Friday the 21st</strong> at midnight. Since the Blaze will not be participating, you can start sending your draft lists to me anytime. I'm not anticipating a lot of action since most teams are either maxed out or currently over the limit of players.</p>
<p>The Pelicans have cut Adrian Sampson, so he'll join the leftovers from the Unowned Draft in the <strong>Waiver Availables</strong> list... which has incidentally just been posted in the Downloads section.</p>"
